                A defining feature of substance use disorders is the disruption of reward systems that regulate goal-directed behavior. Despite the centrality of reward dysfunction to the addiction cycle, contemporary treatments largely focus on cessation and abstinence rather than addressing this core deficit. My research aims to fill this gap by developing neuroscience-based interventions that directly target reward processing to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life.

            <div class="research-area">
                <h3>Neuromodulation for Addiction</h3>
                <p>
                    My current postdoctoral work at Rutgers University's Baker Laboratory employs an integrative MRI-TMS-EEG approach to understand and modulate reward dysfunction in substance users. Using diffusion-weighted imaging tractography, we identify optimal neural targets and deliver precise, robot-assisted transcranial magnetic stimulation to the midcingulate cortex (MCC)—a region critical for utilizing reward prediction errors to assign value to outcomes and guide goal-directed behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have identified a target and pulse protocol that shows robust efficacy at modulating reward-related activity in the MCC, accompanied by strong craving reduction in smokers. By comparing diffusion-weighted imaging-guided targeting versus conventional scalp-based stimulation, we are determining whether individualized, anatomically guided approaches produce superior outcomes—ultimately refining targeting strategies for clinical applications.

                <h3>Reward Processing &amp; Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I use electrophysiological markers to measure changes in reward processing, particularly the Reward Positivity (Rew-P) event-related potential—a neural signature that reflects the brain's response to feedback during reward learning. Substance users consistently exhibit diminished Rew-P amplitude, indicating impaired reward processing. Our excitatory TMS protocol has successfully enhanced smokers' Rew-P to monetary rewards, demonstrating restoration of blunted reward circuitry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Complementing ERP measures, I assess cognitive flexibility using the Probabilistic Selection Task, which measures participants' ability to learn from positive and negative feedback and adapt behavior accordingly. This combination of electrophysiology and computational modeling allows us to understand not just whether reward processing changes, but how the underlying learning mechanisms are affected.
                </p>

            <div class="research-area">
                <h3>Mobile EEG &amp; Real-World Neuroscience</h3>
                <p>
                    During my doctoral training at the University of Alberta, I pioneered methods for studying attention in real-world environments. This included the first successful EEG recordings during active skateboarding, published in the European Journal of Neuroscience. Using an oddball paradigm, we demonstrated that auditory processing is preserved during complex motor activity, opening new avenues for understanding how the brain allocates attention outside laboratory constraints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also conducted systematic investigations of how traffic conditions affect neural processing during urban cycling, finding that increases in surrounding traffic volume are associated with measurable changes in EEG rhythms. This work demonstrates how mobile neuroscience methods can address fundamental questions about cognitive control in ecologically valid settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My commitment to applying neuroscience globally led me to conduct EEG fieldwork in rural Malawi as part of a longitudinal child development study. I trained local volunteers in electrophysiological data collection, combining wearable devices with mobile surveys to study child and youth development. This international experience reinforced my understanding of how neuroscience research can serve diverse populations.

                <h3>Substance Use &amp; Cognitive Control</h3>
                <p>
                    Across my research, I investigate how substance use disorders disrupt the cognitive control systems necessary for goal-directed behavior. In nicotine-dependent individuals, the reward processing system becomes dysregulated, contributing to impaired decision-making and increased relapse vulnerability. My early work examined attentional differences in the presence of cigarette cues among smokers, ex-smokers, and non-smokers, as well as alpha-related inhibitory control differences between these groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This translational focus continues in my current work, where interventions that enhance reward processing may improve individuals' capacity for goal-directed behavior—potentially reducing relapse rates and improving overall quality of life beyond traditional abstinence-focused approaches.

            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I aim to expand this neuromodulation work to other substance use populations, including opioid use disorder, where reward dysfunction is particularly pronounced. I am also interested in investigating how individual differences in neural connectivity patterns predict treatment response, allowing for personalized neuromodulation protocols tailored to each patient's unique neuroanatomy.
