                <h3>University of Alberta Graduate Students Teaching Award, 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    Recognized for dynamic, embodied pedagogical methods that transform how students engage with cognitive neuroscience.

            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I believe cognitive neuroscience becomes most accessible when students can visualize and experience concepts directly. Teaching Brain and Behavior to classes of nearly 400 students, I transform lecture halls into neural circuits—using doorways as synaptic channels and the podium space to demonstrate neurotransmitter release. When explaining bipolar disorder, I create a mood continuum across the classroom, physically demonstrating the inability to "apply brakes" between extremes.
            </p>
            <p>
                This embodied approach, combined with spontaneous connections to students' lived experiences, helps anchor abstract concepts in memorable frameworks. I've implemented large-scale in-class experiments using portable EEG devices, transforming students from passive consumers of knowledge into active contributors to the field.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Connecting with Diverse Students</h2>
            <p>
                My teaching spans three distinct academic environments: the multicultural classrooms of the City College of New York, the research-intensive University of Alberta, and Rutgers University in New Jersey. Each context has deepened my commitment to fostering inclusive learning communities where all students feel valued and supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a multilingual educator fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, I bring cross-cultural insights into the classroom. My international research experience—including EEG fieldwork in rural Malawi where I trained local volunteers—informs how I help students understand that neuroscience research can serve diverse populations while examining potential biases in traditional approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                I establish clear expectations while providing comprehensive, fair assessment and personalized feedback. My commitment to undergraduate mentorship extends beyond the classroom: I have co-authored publications with undergraduate researchers and provided career guidance that has helped students successfully enter graduate and medical programs.
